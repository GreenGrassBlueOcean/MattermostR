\title{Add a user to a channel}
\usage{
add_user_to_channel(
  channel_id,
  user_id,
  resolve_names = TRUE,
  verbose = FALSE,
  auth = get_default_auth()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{channel_id}{The ID of the channel to add the user to.}

\item{user_id}{The ID of the user to add. You can use the string `"me"` to
add the authenticated user.}

\item{resolve_names}{Logical. If `TRUE` (default), fetches readable
usernames and channel names for the success message. Set to `FALSE` to
skip these lookups and save 2 API calls.}

\item{verbose}{Boolean. If `TRUE`, prints the request details.}

\item{auth}{The authentication object created by [authenticate_mattermost()].}
}
\value{
The channel member object returned by the API (invisibly).
}
\description{
Adds a user to a specified Mattermost channel.
}
\details{
By default, the function resolves the user and channel IDs into readable
names for a user-friendly success message (2 extra API calls). Set
`resolve_names = FALSE` to skip these lookups and reduce API traffic to a
single call — useful when adding users in a loop. For true batch operations,
see [add_users_to_channel()].
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Add current user to a channel (with friendly names)
  me <- get_user("me", auth = auth)
  add_user_to_channel(channel_id, me$id, auth = auth)

  # Fast path: skip name resolution
  add_user_to_channel(channel_id, me$id, resolve_names = FALSE, auth = auth)
}
}
