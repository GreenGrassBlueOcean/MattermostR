\title{Add multiple users to a channel in a single API call}
\usage{
add_users_to_channel(
  channel_id,
  user_ids,
  resolve_names = FALSE,
  verbose = FALSE,
  auth = get_default_auth()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{channel_id}{The ID of the channel to add users to.}

\item{user_ids}{A character vector of user IDs (max 1000).}

\item{resolve_names}{Logical. If `TRUE`, fetches readable usernames and
the channel name for the success message (2 extra API calls, regardless
of how many users). Defaults to `FALSE` for efficiency.}

\item{verbose}{Boolean. If `TRUE`, prints the request details.}

\item{auth}{The authentication object created by [authenticate_mattermost()].}
}
\value{
The API response (invisibly). Typically a list with a `channel_id`
  and member details.
}
\description{
Uses the Mattermost batch endpoint to add up to 1000 users to a channel
with a single HTTP request. This is far more efficient than calling
[add_user_to_channel()] in a loop.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Add 50 users to a channel in one shot
  add_users_to_channel(channel_id, user_ids = ids_vector, auth = auth)

  # With friendly names in the message
  add_users_to_channel(channel_id, user_ids = ids_vector,
                       resolve_names = TRUE, auth = auth)
}
}
