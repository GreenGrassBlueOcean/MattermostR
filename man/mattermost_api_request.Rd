\usage{
mattermost_api_request(
  auth,
  endpoint,
  method = "GET",
  body = NULL,
  multipart = FALSE,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{auth}{A list containing the `base_url` and `headers` (which includes the authentication token).}

\item{endpoint}{A string specifying the API endpoint (e.g., `"/api/v4/teams"`).}

\item{method}{A string specifying the HTTP method to use. Options include `"GET"`, `"POST"`, `"PUT"`, and `"DELETE"`.}

\item{body}{(Optional) A list or object representing the body of the request (e.g., for `POST` or `PUT` requests).}

\item{multipart}{(Logical) Set to `TRUE` if the request includes multipart data (e.g., file upload).}

\item{verbose}{(Logical) If `TRUE`, detailed information about the request and response will be printed.}
}
\value{
The content of the response, usually parsed as JSON. On error, raises a
  \code{mattermost_error} condition (default) or returns \code{NULL} (legacy mode).
}
\description{
This function sends an HTTP request to the Mattermost API using authentication details,
endpoint, and method provided. It handles retries with exponential backoff for
failed requests and supports both regular JSON requests and multipart file uploads.
}
\section{Rate Limiting}{

Requests are proactively throttled via \code{httr2::req_throttle()} at a rate
controlled by \code{getOption("MattermostR.rate_limit", 10)} requests per second.
Set to \code{Inf} to disable throttling. The default of 10 matches
Mattermost's out-of-the-box server setting (configurable in System Console).

If the server returns HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests), the retry logic reads the
\code{X-Ratelimit-Reset} header to wait exactly the right number of seconds
before retrying.
}

\section{Error Handling}{

By default, HTTP errors and connection failures raise a \code{mattermost_error}
condition (an S3 error class) that can be caught with
\code{tryCatch(..., mattermost_error = function(e) ...)}.

Set \code{options(MattermostR.on_error = "message")} to revert to the legacy
behaviour where errors are emitted via \code{message()} and the function
returns \code{NULL}.
