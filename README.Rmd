# MattermostR

MattermostR is an R package designed to interact with the Mattermost API for sending messages, managing channels, uploading files, and more.
The package includes functionality for automating interactions with Mattermost from R scripts, allowing you to easily send messages, upload attachments, and manage teams and channels.

## Installation

You can install the MattermostR package from GitHub:

``` r
# Install the devtools package if you don't have it already
install.packages("devtools")

# Install MattermostR
devtools::install_github("GreenGrassBlueOcean/MattermostR")
```

## Features

### 1. Send Messages with Priority

Send messages to Mattermost channels with optional priorities: - **Normal** - **High** - **Low**

The priority is automatically normalized in the `send_mattermost_message()` function, so you don't need to worry about case sensitivity (e.g., `high`, `HIGH`, and `High` are all valid).

### 2. Attach Files to Messages

You can attach files to your messages by specifying a file path.
The file is first uploaded to the Mattermost server, and its file ID is included in the message.

Example:

``` r
response <- send_mattermost_message(
  channel_id = channel_id, 
  message = "Here is your file!", 
  file_path = "output.txt", 
  verbose = TRUE
)
```

### 3. Send Plots as Attachments

You can now directly send plots as attachments to your Mattermost messages.
Supported plot types include:

-   ggplot2 objects
-   R expressions (e.g., quote(plot(cars)))
-   Functions that generate plots (e.g., function() plot(cars))

The plots are automatically saved as .png files and uploaded to the Mattermost server.

Example:

``` r
# Define some plots
library(ggplot2)

plot1 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point()

plot2 <- function() plot(cars)

# Send a message with plot attachments
response <- send_mattermost_message(
  channel_id = channel_id,
  message = "Here are some plots!",
  plots = list(plot1, plot2),
  plot_name = c("scatterplot.png", "lineplot"),
  verbose = TRUE,
  auth = auth
)
```

### 4. Manage Teams and Channels

The package provides tools for managing channels and teams:

1.List Channels and Groups: Retrieve all channels and groups from a team.\
2.Create Channels: Programmatically create new channels in a team.\
3.Delete Channels: Delete existing channels.\
4.Look Up Channels by Name: Find a specific channel by name and get its ID.

### 5. Authentication

Authenticate with the Mattermost API using a bearer token or by providing your username and password.
Once authenticated, the token is stored for future API calls.

``` r
auth <- authenticate_mattermost(
  base_url = "https://yourmattermost.stackhero-network.com", 
  token = "your-token"
)
```

### 6. Error Handling and Validation

Priority Validation: Before sending a message, the priority is validated to ensure that it's one of Normal, High, or Low.
If an invalid priority is provided, the function will return an error.
Input Validation: Ensures that required fields (such as channel_id and message) are provided before making API calls.

## Usage

### Sending a Message

``` r
# Authenticate
auth <- authenticate_mattermost(base_url = "https://yourmattermost.stackhero-network.com", token = "your-token")

# Send a message to a channel
response <- send_mattermost_message(
  channel_id = "your-channel-id", 
  message = "Hello, Mattermost!", 
  priority = "High", 
  verbose = TRUE
)
```

### Sending a Message with a File

``` r
# Send a message with a file attachment
response <- send_mattermost_message(
  channel_id = "your-channel-id", 
  message = "Here is a file attachment", 
  file_path = "path/to/file.txt", 
  verbose = TRUE
)
```

### Managing Channels

``` r
# List all channels in a team
channels <- get_team_channels(team_id = "your-team-id")

# Create a new channel
create_mattermost_channel(team_id = "your-team-id", channel_name = "new-channel", channel_display_name = "New Channel")

# Delete a channel
delete_mattermost_channel(channel_id = "your-channel-id")
```

## Roadmap

Add more Mattermost API endpoints for team and user management.
